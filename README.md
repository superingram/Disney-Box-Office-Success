# Disney-Box-Office-Success
Since the 1930s, Walt Disney Studios has released more than 600 films covering a wide range of genres. While some movies are indeed directed towards kids, many are intended for a broad audience. In this project, Disney movie data will be analyzed to see how Disney movies have changed in popularity since its first movie release. We will perform hypothesis testing to see what aspects of a movie contribute to its success along with statistical inference and two-sample bootstrap hypothesis tests for difference of means.
